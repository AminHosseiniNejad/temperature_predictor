# temperature_predictor
In this project, different models to predict temperature of Sturup city in Sweden in 3 different ways;
with and without using any external inputs as models A and B, and using Kalman filter to build a recursive
predicting model as model C. It was also tried to simplify the Kalman-filter-based model by excluding the
parameters whose effects are not significant in the model performance as the simplified model C. The best model is the simplified model C in term of high performance and low complexity.
